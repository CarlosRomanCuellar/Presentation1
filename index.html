            <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML pages are domuments that  use tags (also called elements), this tags usually come in pairs to show when an element start and when it ends <br>
                    the openning one can have attr             
                    
                    
                    
                    ibutes that can make the element show or behave one way or another, this attributes require a name and a value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tags act like containers that tell you about the information between their opening and closing tags. Examples of this are the html, head and body tags,<br>
                    The html tag indicates that everything inside is HTML code. The head tag contains information of the page and most of this is not show in the browser<br> window.
                    The body tag indicates that all between the opening and closing tags is what is going to appear in the browsers window.

        <article id="chapter2">
            <h2>Text</h2>
            <p>
                In HTML exist the headings, this are represent by the tags <strong>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 </strong> and are usually use for titles ans subtitles. 
                An example of h1 <br> 
                is the one above that says HTML. <br>
                The headings are often shown in bold by default but this can be modified.
            </p>

            <p>The tag <strong>p</strong> stands for paragraph and we have been using this tag for the texts above.<br> 
                In the text we can make use of the tags <strong>b and i</strong> that are use to 
                make the text <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> respectively. we can also use the tags  <strong>sub and sup</strong> to<br>
                show subscript or superscript characters like the 2 in H<sub>2</sub>O or when we raise a number to the square like 10 <sup>2</sup>.<br>
                
                <br>
                When we are writing a paragraph in html and need to jump to an other line we can use the <strong>br</strong> or <strong>hr</strong> tags but if we use 
                <strong >hr</strong> this will draw a line<br>
                to divide the themes, if we try to use just the enter  this won't work because when the browser comes across two or more spaces it only display one. <br>
                
                <br>
                There is an other way to make the text display in bold and this is by using <strong>the strong tag</strong>, but it's principal function is to show that
                whatever is <br> 
                in the tag is very important.The same way that there is another way to make the text display in bold there is an other for italic, 
                this is by using <br> 
                the em tag that stands for emphasis and should be used to make <em> emphasis </em>that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. 
                
            </p>

            <h4>Quotations</h4>
            <blockquote>
            <p>The blockquote element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>For shoter quotes we use the <strong>q tag</strong> like this <q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>

            <h4>Abbreviations and acronyms</h4>
            <p>In HTML we can use an abbreviation or an acronym whith the <strong> abbr and acronym</strong> tags, these must have the property title to specify the full term <br>
                like <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> and <acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space
                Administration">NASA</acronym>
            </p>

            

            <p>Using the tag <strong>del</strong> <del>the text will apear like this</del>, if we use the tag <strong>ins</strong> <ins>the text will apear like this</ins></p>
            <!--The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it-->

            <h2>Lists</h2>

            <p>In HTML we have 3 types of lists, numbered, bullet and definition, all these 3 can be nested. An example of a bullet list is the one at the top<br>
                of this page, a numbered list can be like the following:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>option 1<br>
                    <ol reversed>
                        <li>A</li>
                        <li>B</li>
                        <li>C</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>option 2</li>
                <li>option 3</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The numbers in this list can be inverted if we use the propperty <strong>reversed</strong> </p>
            
            <p>A definition list can be like the next one:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><b>dt</b></dt>
                <dd>The term being defined</dd>
                <dt><b>dd</b></dt>
                <dd>The definition of the respective dt</dd>
            </dl>

            <h2>Links</h2>

            <p>Links are the defining feature of the web because with them we move from one web to an other</p>

            <p>links are created using the <strong>a tag </strong>and this tag has the next structure:<br>
                <blockquote>
                    &lt;a href="the page the link takes you to"&gt;clickable text for the user&lt;/a&gt;
                </blockquote>
                
                A valid example is:

                <blockquote>
                    &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;search in google&lt;/a&gt;
                </blockquote>
                
                URL stands for Uniform Resource  Locator. This is the web address that you see or type in the browser, when you link to a different website, <br>
                the value of the href will be the full web address and this is know as an absolute URL, an example is the one of google that we already see.
            </p>

            <h3>Directory</h3>
            <p>Folders in websites are referred to as directories and is a good idea to organize the code by placing the pages into different folders.<br>
                The  top level folder is know as root and contains the home page of the site, this page is called index, any folder inside the root is know as a child<br>
                and any folder in a child of root is a grandchild of root.<br>
                <br>
                Relative URLs is linking the page with your own website, there are 5  types of relative urls that are:<br>
                <table border="1">
                    <thead>
                        <th >Type</th>
                        <th >Example</th>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Same folder</td>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>child folder</td>
                            <td>&lt;a href="childFolder/examples.html"&gt;Examples&lt;/a&gt;</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>Grandchild folder</td>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>

                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </p>

            <p>We can make a link to prepare an email to a specific email address by using the next structure<br>
                &lt;a href="mailto:name@whatever.com"&gt;clickable text&lt;/a&gt; this will look like this:
            </p>
            <a class="link" href="mailto:name@whatever.com">clickable text</a>

            <p>To open a link in a new tab we must add the attribute target and give it the value of "_blank"</p>
            <a class="link" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">google</a>

            <p>
                The tag img is use to add images in the webpages, this tag is a inline element so it can be implemented in <br>
                a line like this, <img src="images/dices-small.png"  alt="a group of dices" title="dices" height="70" width="100" />
                To include an image in a site we use the &lt;img&gt; tag we must use the attribute src to indicate where is the image<br>
                and which one we'll implement. We can make use of the tag figure but this element is a block elemnt so it won't show in the same line
                <!--the  alt property is to give a description if you can't see the image
                    the title property is to show a title of the image when the cursor is on top of the image

                </figure>
                </div>
                The figcaption element is use to give a caption of the image and before this element there was no way to conect a img to a caption

            <h2>Tables</h2>
            <p> tables are created by using the &lt;table&gt; tag and the content is written row by row, between the opening and closing tags of table <br>
            we will have the <strong>tr</strong> tags that represent the rows of the table, and the <strong>td</strong> tags that are the cells. There is also the  <strong>th</strong> tags that work<br>
            the same way as the td but the th are use to represent the heading of a column or a row. an example of this is the table of the directory types above.</p>

                For Long tables there are 3 tags that will help, these are:

            <h2>Markup</h2>
            <p>The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element from the others in the same page.</p>
            <p>The class attribute can also be carried by any element and its good to identify a grup of elements</p>

            <p>We can group different types of elements in a div element this will act like a box and let you manage the elements as a block</p>

            <p> The iframe can be seen as a window where you can see another page, the content can be any html page.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is an element call meta (&lt;meta&gt;) that is on the head of the page, this information is not visible to the user but it can contain <br>
                information about your page such as who made it, keywords or a description of the page.

            <h2>Video & audio</h2>
             <p>
                In HTML we can add videos to give "live" to the page 
            </p>

            <video class="bordervid" poster="images/dices.png" width="400" height="300" preload="auto" controls loop autoplay="autoplay">

                <source src="videos/videoplayback.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />
                <p>A father discovers something about his daughter</p>
            </video>
            <!--preload make the browser to load the video until the user press play
                if the value is auto the page load the video when the page loads
            -->
            <!--controls tell the browser to use its own controls-->
            <!--loop makes the video to start again once its finish-->

            <p>
                The same way we can add a video to a web page we can also add an audio, but is becoming less common unless the site is for this porpuse

            <audio src="audio/Aplausos.mp3" controls>
